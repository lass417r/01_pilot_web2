            Sebastian Wibe is an 21-year-old DJ & Producer from Denmark. Despite
            his young age, Sebastian has already managed to get support from
            major international artists such as Tiesto, Martin Garrix, Nicky
            Romero and Don Diablo. Sebastians style can best be described as
            future house with elements of pop. The young Dane with the Peruvian
            roots has passed over 5 million combined streams on Spotify, Youtube
            and Soundcloud and is currently followed by over 30.000 people on
            his social medias. In 2016, Sebastian caught the attention of two of
            the worlds biggest DJ's, Tiesto and Martin Garrix, who both several
            times played his remix of Snow Patrol - Chasing Cars. Furthermore,
            A-list DJ's Bassjackers went on to include the remix in their sets
            at Tomorrowland and Ushuaia Ibiza.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time, Sebastian also released his newest single 'Fall
            Like A Hero' which would go on to climb the Viral Chart in both
            Denmark and Sweden and getting picked up by DJ's and blogs around
            the world, including Nicky Romero, Lost Frequencies and Dash Berlin.
            2017 was the year Sebastian began to play bigger shows, establishing
            himself as a solid live act. He performed at festivals such as
            Smukfest and Distortion in Denmark and Starbeach in Greece, as well
            as opening for artists such as Quintino and Otto Knows. In 2018
            Sebastian released the catchy future-pop single ’Fighting Me’ on the
            Big & Dirty/Be Yourself imprint in the Netherlands. The song took
            off quickly, streaming a little over 150.000 streams on Spotify
            within the first week, as well as reaching the top of the Viral
            charts, charting at #2 in Denmark, #26 in Netherlands and Top 50 in
            Austria and Lithuania. Sebastian Wibe is only getting started, so
            keep your ears and eyes open for this young and talented Dane!
